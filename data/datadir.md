<h2>Project Proposal</h2>

**DESCRIPTION:** One of the most common issues a person has is not knowing what is inside their pantry. This 
leads to unnecessary purchases of ingredients already in the household, or starting a culinary project only to discover
fundamental pieces were missing. Moreover, it is also quite easy to lose track of what is in your pantry/ fridge which
results miscellaneous pieces of fruit or leftovers from a month ago slowly rotting in the back of your fridge. This
application aims to solve all of these problems for people all over the world. Through a set of very simple inputs
after shopping for groceries, this program will be able to keep track of what you currently have in your pantry,
how much of it is currently left and its expiration date. Moreover, it will notify users when to throw out expired 
food and when they are running low on certain items. The last function is that users are able to input ingredients
to a recipe they would like to make, and the program will return what they are missing/ what they need more of.
